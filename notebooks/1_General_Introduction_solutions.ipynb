    "Plotting and saving your figures in png and pdf files is very useful. While writing your articles, you will be able to go back to your figures, change details and prepare them for \"printing\". One of the important points to be aware of while creating our figures, is readability. The reader has to be able to recognize, without squinting their eyes or zooming, what the legend is, titles, any comments or scales. You can change your figure/writing ration with playing with \"figsize\". Depending on your figure, you will have to adjust its size. The difference will not be noticeable on our notebooks, however while adjusting your figures, the trick is to open your file every time you reload it."

    "However, this also means that with a lot of different values for parameters, the run will take longer to finish. Take into account that the time will increase exponentially: if you have 1 parameter with 4 values, then you run 4 models. If you have 2 parameters with 4 values, you already have 16 runs. If you add more, you can increase your model runs into three or four digits very fast (ex: $7*7*7*7$...)."

You will find the bootstrap model (basic minimun for LEM), basic model (standart model), sediment model and marine models. New models can be added too.  All these have different set of equations they are based on, which means that they are put together with different processes.
